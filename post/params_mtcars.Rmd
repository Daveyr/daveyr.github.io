## Mtcars

With parameterised reporting it is possible to feed in parameters using the `params:` section in the YAML header, and use these values within a `params` list object. This example uses the number of cylinders to filter the `mtcars` dataset and plot and show this filtered dataset. Common use cases within business could be reporting by region or by financial quarter.

```{r cars, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)

df <- mtcars %>%
  filter(cyl == params$cyl)

kable(df, caption = paste0("Table of cars with cyl == ", params$cyl))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = paste0("Relationship between mpg and disp for ", params$cyl, " cylinder cars"))
```
